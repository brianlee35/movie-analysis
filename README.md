# Movie Analysis

**Author**: Brian Lee

## Overview

This project analyzes the movie industry and aims to provide recommendations for the "new Microsoft studio". The descriptive analysis of movie datasets from IMDB, Box Office Mojo, and The Numbers show that specific genres have a higher likelihood of popularity and commerical success and that a larger production budget leads to larger profits. Microsoft can use this analysis to choose better genres for lower budgets, to predict changes in viewer tastes, and to decide best budget limits for future films.

## Business Problem

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they don’t know anything about creating movies. You are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.
